lead_text: 'ORTTransformer is an Android app designed for on-device fine-tuning and text generation using large language models (LLMs). The app leverages ONNX Runtime training for training and the ONNX Generative AI framework for inference, ensuring both processes are performed entirely on-device. It incorporates a pipeline that converts Huggingface transformer models into optimized formats for mobile deployment, making it possible to fine-tune and generate text all completely locally on the edge.'
